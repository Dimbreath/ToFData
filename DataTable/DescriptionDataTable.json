Standard: \r\nView the related page for the detailed progressive rates.\r\n3. Tanium refunded in different brackets will be added together to be the total amount you'll receive.\r\n4. For Monthly Passes, Passes, Cash Packs, etc., in the Suppressor - Final Test, only the amount of your purchase will be refunded. Other rewards will not be included.\r\n\r\nExample\r\nShrooman has made purchases of 648 USD in the Suppressor - Final Test.\r\nFor the 0–6 USD segment of his spending, 6 × 500% × 10 = 300 Tanium will be refunded to him.\r\nFor the 7–100 USD segment, (100 - 6) × 400% × 10 = 3760 Tanium will be refunded.\r\nFor the 101–648 USD segment, (648 - 100) × 300% × 10 = 16440 Tanium will be refunded.\r\nTherefore, 300 + 3760 + 16440 = 20500 Tanium is the total amount Shrooman will receive.\r\n\r\nRefund Calculation Rules\r\nPurchases made by the same account across servers in the Suppressor - Final Test will all be counted for the refund.\r\nFor example, during the test period, Shrooman has spent 10 USD on Server A and 20 USD on Server B, which adds up to 30 USD in total. Here is how we get the total amount of refund he'll get: \r\nFor the 0–6 USD segment, he'll get 6 × 500% × 10 = 300 Tanium.\r\nFor the 7–30 USD segment, he'll get (30 - 6) × 400% × 10 = 960 Tanium.\r\nIn total, he'll get: 300 + 960 = 1260 Tanium.\r\n\r\nRefund Collection Rules\r\n1. Wanderers' purchases in the Suppressor - Final Test will all be refunded in Tanium to one account according to the \"Suppressor - Final Test Purchase Refund Policy\" after the official launch.\r\n2. The refund amount of the Suppressor - Final Test is calculated separately from that of the Suppressor - Amplification Test (3). If Wanderers have made purchases in both tests, the amount spent in both tests will be refunded after the official launch.\r\n3. The refunded amount can be collected on the refund page in game.
