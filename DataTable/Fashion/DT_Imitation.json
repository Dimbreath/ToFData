After careful analysis, the security department decided to send a team of Executors to the address.\n\nThe Executors treated the situation as if it was a booby trap, even evacuating nearby residents. When they knocked down the door and rushed into the unit, they were surprised to find a young man enjoying an ice cream cone. The only thing Zero said to them was, \"what took you so long?\"\n\nBefore revealing his true identity, his intentions were unknown, and he was considered extremely dangerous. Once they found out that he was just a teenager, however, they had no idea what to do about him. After a lengthy negotiation, it was agreed that Hykros will put Zero in an undisclosed location, where he would do intelligence-related work under the supervision of someone.",

Having an observer for Zero was evidently not very effective.\n\nThe person working on the file originally wanted to write things down, so that Zero wouldn't change anything. The observer opposed the idea, \"Zero had the right to see those things, and if he wanted to change the information, we should give him that option.\"\n\nAfter an update, everything about Zero in the dossier mysteriously disappeared, with only a single line of code that decrypts to, \"none of your business!\"",

The entire security team was expecting something spectacular, but they were disappointed. The observer knows very little about Zero so far: what games he likes to play, what are his favorite drinks when he stays up late, or the fact that Zero hates going out. His ex-coworkers joked that he has become Zero's mother, taking care of the socially awkward young genius.\n\nBut when the observer watches Zero from the other side of the glass, he sometimes gets the feeling that he's one step closer to understanding this prodigy. Zero's behavior may look impulsive and playful on the surface, but the more he watches, the more he realizes that it's Zero's unique way of hiding his true intentions, which is something all teenagers try to do at this age. As to what he wants to do, why he willingly came to Hykros, and his Simulacrum data... no one knows. The observer doesn't want to dig up Zero's past, but he does want to communicate with Zero better, and becomes his friend if possible.

The edges are crystal-clear and sharp. The weapon researchers were intrigued by it when she came to Hykros with it. At some point, a brave scientist borrowed the weapon from Meryl for research, off the record. The results only left the researchers itching for more information. But even after several in-depth experiments, they still couldn't figure out what it's made of, let alone take it apart.\n\nThe impact of a girl showing up on the battlefield with a claymore is powerful - elegant, wild, and even a little strange. Her moves are delicate yet straightforward, utilizing the weight of the claymore to make her swings simple and powerful and making her unstoppable. Executors generally consider the energy consumption of their suppressors and choose lighter weapons, but Meryl's physical strength and her quick mind enabled her to wield Rosy Edge with ease.\n\nIt's difficult enough for an ordinary person to just pick up a heavy weapon like the claymore, let alone swinging it freely and unleashing destruction, which requires tremendous stamina and strength. Moreover, becoming proficient and learning actual skills require further training of the body and the mind. Having a dash of talent also makes it easier. As for deciding what techniques to use and when to use them, analyzing the enemy's tactics, and countering on the fly, having a quick and decisive mind is a must.\n\nObjectively speaking, Meryl does have the talent and the perseverance required for a swordswoman. And by going through the Executor's reports, it's not hard to see that her abilities go above and beyond what is required of an Executor.",

No snarking allowed. -Dr. Joaquin\r\n\r\nObservation Log II-003\r\nToday is my 35th day with Hykros, as well as my 35th day with the icy Executor in front of me. Her attitude toward me is just as bad as the first day we met.\r\n\r\nThis is awful. I have to submit a report in two days, but I couldn't even get close to the Executor, let alone get in touch with her! No, I can't give up, I must finish the job. I won't get promoted unless I finish evaluating Meryl, and promotion might be my only chance to find my childhood sweetheart. I got to tough this out.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I was both nervous and excited on my first day for the job, wondering what kind of work they would have for me. An elder gentleman ended up telling me it's to monitor and record Executors' lives and combat conditions, plus assisting their operations by their side, as well as turning in regular reports. Ms. Meryl wasn't the original Executor I was assigned to, but for some reason, no one wanted to be her observer, so I volunteered to score brownie points. Well, now I know why no one wanted the task, because it's VERY, VERY HARD! I couldn't even get close enough to talk or get to know her...\r\n\r\nBut to this date, I still remember clearly about seeing Meryl for the first time here... It was straight out of a painting, with her standing faraway, unmoving, lost in thoughts. Everyone walked around her and kept their distance. I didn't think much of it and went up to greet her, but she might or might not have heard me, though I noticed her eyes moved a little, before she completely ignored me again. Did I do something rude? Hope she didn't hate me for it.\r\n\r\nWait, why did I digress? Anyway, what am I going to do for the report?\r\n\r\nObservation Log Ⅳ-165\r\n177 in all. If I remember correctly, that's how many crystals in Meryl's collection. She prefers crystals with strange shapes, especially ones in blue and white. Are they her two favorite colors? Why did she collect them? It's been a long time and I still know hardly anything about Meryl. Does this mean I'm bad with this job?\r\n\r\nSince I basically can't go near Meryl, I'm limited to logging her daily and work routines, but that won't be enough... I'll go ask other observers about her tomorrow, maybe I'll get something out of them.\r\n\r\nObservation Log Ⅴ-049\r\nIt's been freezing lately, snowing practically every day, covering the land in white. The cold is getting to me. God knows when this freaking weather will get better.\r\n\r\nHowever, Meryl seems to love snowing days. I can sense emotion from her when it snows, but is it loneness or sorrow? My vocabulary is lacking when it comes to describing precise sentiments. I jotted it down in the report to the superiors, and they told me I was just seeing things, that I was compensating for Meryl ignoring me for so long.\r\n\r\nI don't think so, of course, because it was obvious and tangible.\r\n\r\nObservation Log Ⅶ-482\r\nWarren Snowfield is supposedly icebound in perennial ice and very inhospitable. I thought I'd never set foot in such environment, but reality said differently. Now, I'm in a cabin somewhere in Warren Snowfield, writing a log while waiting for the blizzard outside to stop. More importantly, I sprained my ankle. Even more importantly, Meryl saved me. I got an order to deliver provisions to her, then I fell into a trap here, followed by us trapped in the blizzard.\r\n\r\nBut it's not all bad. Maybe the snowstorm reminded her of something and we actually got to chat a little. I found out she comes around here often to find her missing younger brother, and that Warren used to be their childhood home a long time ago. Her brother's name is Victor, who joined Hykros and became an Executor before her. I couldn't access any information on Victor probably because he is classified as missing. If I can uncover more clues, I may be able to help Meryl...",

I apologize for not referring to you more formally, but if you can see this, then you must care about Meryl a lot.\n\nI have included some of the information I compiled on Meryl below. They were collected during my time as an observer, and will never be made public out of respect. Only those with special access may view this file.\n\nMeryl's full name is Melvinier Lisatzya, and she came from a swordsman family that had already seen its decline. The oppression against her family directly led to the death of her parents, leaving her and Victor, her brother, on their own. They were separated during their exile, and Meryl was rescued by a Hykros staff member. Maybe it had something to do with what happened during the exile, Meryl strongly opposed being adopted, and refused to communicate with others. She closed herself off from others, until she reunited with Victor in Hykros.\n\nHykros had invited Meryl to become an Executor many times because of her excellent swordsmanship, but she either refused or ignored the invitations. Looking back, the fact that Victor became an Executor might have been the reason for her to join, because she was always worried about him. She told me that her time spent with Victor here was the happiest. I still think about it from time to time. But... unfortunately, I couldn't get more information on Victor, other than that he went missing in Warren Snowfield during a mission. I hope Victor will come back to Hykros one day, and I hope that day comes soon.\n\nHaving spent a long time with Meryl, I think I've just started to understand her. She doesn't know how to communicate with others, she doesn't know how to handle a dying plant, she can't cook, but she's very serious about her job. She trains diligently every day, enjoys reading, sometimes even falling asleep with a book in her hands... In my eyes, she is an adorable girl who is kind and clumsy, but also aloof and lonely. Now that I can no longer be by her side... I am a little worried about her. Several days ago, I received a notice that I will be promoted to consultant, and be reassigned to another area. I don't want to leave Meryl, but the love of my life lives where I am being reassigned to, and I look forward to being with him again after all these years of searching for him.\n\nI will be leaving tomorrow to move on with my life and pursue my happiness. I am writing this down in hopes that it will help you, who undoubtedly cares about Meryl. It might be selfish of me and very unrealistic to think of this, but I sincerely hope that one day, one way or another, she will no longer be alone. I want to see her smile from the bottom of her heart, and it will be the most beautiful smile in this world. ",

The Mirroria personnel unfamiliar with Meryl thought she was in a bad mood and wondered if they had done something wrong. When asked, Meryl reassured a staff member with a glance, and while emotionless, it was also devoid of malice or blame.\r\n\r\nIn fact, only Meryl herself knew that Rosy Edge was ringing with excitement, or even that Meryl, who was with Rosy Edge, was also excited. Rosy Edge, her partner that had weathered many storms with her, also sensed her excitement for Vera. Meryl kept herself ready for combat, just like back in Aesperia, and no one could escape from her or her Rosy Edge.\r\n\r\nMeryl heard an Executor had once come to Vera, stopped Sage's plot, and saved Aesperia.\r\n\r\nMeryl was somehow intrigued by this: Could that someone be the very person in front of her?",

Her tone of voice, actions, and aloofness can be discerned by even the most oblivious of people, and serve as a natural deterrent for any would-be approachers.\r\n\r\nSamir tends to keep away from others unless she needs them... Or feels like playing mean pranks on them to entertain herself.\r\n\r\nOnly those who have never had the displeasure of meeting Samir will respect her and look forward to working with her, only to unanimously consider the experience a regretful (and sometimes painful) one afterward.\r\n\r\nBut Samir cares little and less about her interpersonal relationship within Hykros; she simply follows her heart and does as she pleases.",

Her apartment is full of solved sudoku books and detective fiction, and she buys newspapers only for the crossword puzzles. When she feels like it, she even designs board games and sees if anyone wants to play. So far, there haven't been any takers...",

But her test results were so good that they only checked the bare minimum, which were her background and reason for joining, before admitting her.\r\n\r\nThere was evidence that she was in Banges the whole time before joining Hykros. She never even touched a weapon when she was a teenager. It really seemed like this girl, who could have lived an otherwise uneventful life, only wanted to join Hykros, and that becoming an Executor was a nice bonus. I think she came looking for a friend in Hykros.\r\n\r\nWho is this friend? I have no idea, and she has never mentioned it. She doesn't like it when people ask her about it, either. For your own good, you should stay away from this question.\r\n\r\nBut if I were to guess, I'd say that the friend is not someone that anyone can meet easily. I've never seen anyone having a good time with Samir. And given what I know about her, if she's already accomplished her objective, why would she still be here?

Those who know this reached a contradicting conclusion: Samir is both herself and not herself. What would Samir say about this? Maybe she doesn't care.\r\n\r\nBut the staff at Hykros did get something wrong.\r\n\r\nThey seem to think she's more loyal than she seems.\r\n\r\nShe'll just scoff at whoever is brave enough to point it out, and, after a few seconds, add, \"so what?\"\r\n\r\nYes, so what?

I'm impressed!\" \n\nThat's a conversation between staff in a Hykros restaurant one day. \n\nThere is no question that something that had a profound effect on Samir happened to her when she left the ranks of the Executor Order without authorization. However, there are no records of what happened, what she experienced, or other details. Her actions during this time were only vaguely recorded as \"misdeeds\" in her judgment order, which means this description has no reference value at all. \n\nThe only thing we know for sure is that Samir seemed like a completely different person after returning to the Executor Order. She, who never bothered to cooperate with anyone, actually followed a new Executor and acted according to her instructions. According to an Executor who had been badly teased by Samir in the past: \"She was like a puppy who follows her master happily after leaving home for the first time. If she had a tail, surely she would be wagging it nonstop! \" \n\nOf course, we can't rule out the possibility that this Executor's observation is sarcastic and derisive due to their personal grievances, but one must admit that the current Samir seemed a lot more reliable than in the past. Therefore, her request to provide support to Vera was unanimously passed without much argument. \n\nBut I also heard that her application was not written according to the specifications. In fact, I think she only lightheartedly said to Dr. Joaquin: \"Huma is going there, so I will go there too.\" \n\nAnyway, everyone has already gotten used to her being like this now.",

Since waking up, the sum of Huma's knowledge about the world is limited to Hykros. Everything else merely makes her a little afraid and anxious.\n\nPresently, all of Huma's personal relationships are with those medical researchers whom she has gotten to know during her treatment. These researchers have suggested Huma accompany others to explore the outside world, in the hopes of gradually returning her to a more normal existence. Huma, however, made an astonishing decision — choosing to be trained as a Hykros Executor.\n\nThe girl's reasoning is simple and pure — she feels reassured in the company of Executors, and wishes to use her abilities to pay back the kindness Hykros has shown her.",

Ultimately, through some... special means, Huma took part in a pioneering experiment and was able to wake up. However, she lost every shred of memory since her birth, to the point where her personality was almost fully erased. Fortunately, her intelligence was preserved, and Huma relied on it to re-learn everything with the help of the medical staff.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say that this is the same Huma as before, because her personality was wiped clean. On one hand, she is an adult, but on the other, she has not experienced the world outside the hospital. Huma's journey is just beginning.",

After the medical staff discovered the presence of this aftereffect, Huma's first rehabilitation task was to learn to control her immense strength. Like picking up a glass of water, simple, mundane tasks proved to be nearly-insurmountable challenges for Huma. For this reason, the doctors and nurses tasked with her treatment could not help but applaud softly when she was finally able to take a sip of her drink without shattering the glass; they were fully aware of how much effort Huma had put into this simple act.\r\n\r\nThe Molten Shield V2 is a specially designed weapon for Huma upon her acceptance into the Executor Order. A versatile weapon that can switch freely between shield and axe forms, Huma seems to appreciate the fighting style to which it lends itself; with it, she can become either the ultimate shield or the ultimate spear, as necessary. Though her expression is often inscrutable, perhaps her actions reflect her heart's innermost beliefs and hopes?",

Her seniors often praise her improvements, and the medical staff marvel at her transformation. She is expanding her social circle and exploring her surroundings, like a hatchling that is about to make its first sounds.\r\n\r\nBut since she lost all of her memories, her experiences and her understanding of what this particular world has gone through are on the same level as a seven-year-old child. Going out and actually seeing what's happening on Aida is akin to exploring the unknown. Will she become jaded after finding out what has happened to this world? The future is uncertain, but the tenderness and hope in Huma's eyes and the resolve and confidence in her heart will make her journey less frightening.",

Maybe it's because of her superhuman strength, or her dominating aura during battle, or even the fact that she just looks like a serious person even on her days off, but other Executors fear and respect her, and don't treat her like a friend. They only know the most basic information about her, and never tried to dig deeper. On the other hand, after seeing how awkward it is for the others, Huma sighs and goes back to her book, even though she really wants to get to know them.\r\n\r\nRecently, however, she realized something else: she has an affinity toward animals.\r\n\r\nFirst, it was a dog wagging its tail in front of her. Then some bunnies came to hang out with her. A cat in the shelter that doesn't like strangers slept on her knees for an afternoon. She started spending more time on the surface just so she could be with these animals.\r\n\r\nIt's easy for humans to build walls that divide one another, and they will always find more reasons to not remove these walls.

Her current status is unknown, but it is certain she is not a lowly lackey within the Heirs, given her abilities.\n\nNever relies on philosophy, morals, goals, or rules to decide which side she will align with, as if she never cares for any of that.

That wasn't rare, but she stood out from the others that were around her age when she arrived.\r\n\r\nNot many at the shelter remember Tsubasa these days. When asked, they only say that she left quietly, and that there were no indications that she was going to leave. In one of the testimonials about her last days at the shelter, she was happily sharing food from her hunting trips with everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a winter day, a wandering girl came to the shelter. Since the shelter routinely helped out rovers, it was routine and almost didn't have to be recorded. But some said that her reason for joining was... eccentric.\r\n\r\nNo one remembers what happened exactly. She was so frail and skinny, as if no one took care of her. It was difficult to imagine how she managed to survive on Astra, where bandits and thieves ruled. Her hair was a mess and covered half of her face, but her eyes shone.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then she asked a simple, straightforward, and innocent question.\r\n\r\n\"Between you guys, the Hyenas, and the Ravagers, who's the strongest on this island?\"",

After all, she did share what was on her mind with some acquaintances.\r\n\r\nFor example, when she was explaining archery to the Hyena archers, she said, \"because of gravity and wind, no arrow flies straight. So for an archer, the most important ability is to make friends with gravity and wind, and feel them to get better at firing arrows.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIf one projects her values and experiences onto this quote, one might come to the conclusion that she was also talking about interpersonal relationships. People are like arrows, and no one is able to remain the same throughout their life, as they will be influenced by the environment they are in. So it's very important to figure out the environment, figure out what they want, and predict where this world might be headed.\r\n\r\nShe is the best example of these values. However, it will be a long, long time before we can see the results of her predictions.",

But during the application process, we found two... non-critical problems. They didn't stop her from being admitted, but we decided to give her a longer training and observation period, instead of assigning her to a team right away.\" These were from the evaluations by her proctor, who went into detail about the two \"non-critical problems.\"\r\n\r\nFirst, her body temperature is lower than others. Abnormally low.\r\n\r\nSecond, her last name sounded like she came from a noble family, but that didn't fit her. Could it be a fake name?\r\n\r\nEither way, it wouldn't have been difficult for her to become an Executor, because her physical prowess and intelligence were both dramatically above the average for people her age. More importantly, her survival and hunting skills demonstrated during the evaluation were off the charts.\r\n\r\nThe proctor was expecting a grand answer, something along the lines of agreeing with ideals or visions about the future, when he asked her, \"you don't look like you're troubled, and you can do more than just fine with your skills. So why do you want to join Hykros?\"\r\n\r\nShe said, \"no reason in particular, I just want to be where it's buzzing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShe betrayed Hykros shortly after her observation period ended.",

The Heirs, on the other hand, are a place where formalities are thrown out of the window, and they make use of just about everything. She'll definitely feel freer there.\r\n\r\nThis sounds, bad, but never putting oneself in the same position and only moving to where the power is, is kind of like not having a \"self.\" But from another perspective, one can argue that despite moving onto something else, one still leaves behind traces, impressions, and ideas. In a way, I think she knows exactly what she's doing, and maybe she has taken her \"self\" to the next level, beyond our comprehension.",

She chose planetary oceanography as her specialization, and started investigating the oceans of Aida as an oceanographer.\n\nIt's not easy to study the ocean, because she often had to face powerful enemies when trying to obtain first-hand information. Those who don't know her always wondered why Shiro picked this path and considered it a waste of her talents, but those who do know her thought her choice made perfect sense.\n\nShiro lived by the ocean when she was young. With almost no friends and family, she blew conch shells and was immediately captivated by the sounds they make, and cried when crabs pinched her fingers. Having spent countless days by the ebbing and flowing tides, the ocean is her friend, and she is fiercely loyal to it.\n",

She takes advantage of the technology to learn about the different schools of fish, trying to figure out what they're feeling and thinking.\r\n\r\nShiro gets angry when her carefully placed sensors are ruined by enemies, but she quickly collects herself and sets them up again to continue her search. She'll even smile uncharacteristically like a child getting a new toy when she obtains good results from her experiments.\r\n\r\nHer weapon comes from a gear-shaped component of a seawater purification system that was supposed to be destroyed after decommissioning. It is sturdy enough to withstand the water pressure from the deepest depths of the ocean, and its teeth are strong enough to tear any armor apart. Shiro modified it into a weapon and called it the \"Chakram of the Seas.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen her research report about Aida's oceans was published, people followed her conclusions and made new discoveries in areas that were previously deemed useless. The ores in those areas managed to restore several areas that required extensive reconstruction after the Cataclysm.",

Shiro opposed the over-development of the ocean, because she thought it would further damage the environment, and humanity would suffer in the long run. Her view was not recognized by some researchers in the lab, and Shiro eventually left the lab altogether after more unpleasantries. She turned her attention to protecting the ecology of the ocean, trying to find a compromise between development and preservation.\n\nThe over-development of the ocean did have an impact on the reconstruction effort, and Shiro's view was eventually taken seriously. When the data of a key part of a new seawater purification system was missing, her Chakram of the Seas became the only sample available. They reverse-engineered her weapon, and recreated the required component to complete the new purification system. With Shiro and the researchers' hard work, some of the damaged ecologies were able to restore themselves in the long run.",

He's been fighting since childhood and is a veteran brawler specializing in one-against-many. He would get lucrative pays for each job, only to supposedly blow it all immediately.",

After much string-pulling, we managed to contact him through an engineer we worked with, and finally got a chance to negotiate... or rather, strike a deal with him.\r\n\r\nHe didn't want anything that Hykros provided—long-term benefits, point of contact, further services, proof of friendship—none whatsoever. He wanted cash, and that was non-negotiable.\r\n\r\nSo we paid him a handsome amount for us to take his data for the Simulacrum. This amount still sticks out like a sore thumb in our accounting records.\r\n\r\nPlease note that we think KING is purely motivated by money, and this is completely reflected in the AI of the Simulacrum. Please don't think that he would help just because your interests aligned. Without money, it's difficult to make him do anything.\r\n\r\nStrange, isn't it? He pretty much wins every fight he's involved in, but you'll find that he doesn't always enter battles willingly. Why is that? Is it because battles don't have the same fun and sense of accomplishment? Or... is it because he measures everything with money, and not those intangible emotions? \r\n\r\n\r\n- Hykros Simulacrum Research Department",

He grew up in the mines and started at the bottom, and his future had already been decided—he would become another cog in the machine that was the mine.\r\n\r\nSo what derailed this little mine cart? No one knew exactly what happened. Maybe it was an argument, a fight, or just a random rebellious moment. Before he realized it, he had already been involved in the gangs there, and was being trained as a fighter.\r\n\r\nAs he grew older in such an environment, he picked up all the bad things about it, especially a bad habit that \"spread like the plague in the mines.\" \r\n\r\nWe could have predicted how it would end for him.\r\n\r\nBut he proved that he was able to get out of it all, \r\n\r\nhowever unreasonable his getaway was.",

I hope we can work together to create an environment where he simply can't compete anymore.\r\n\r\nI'm sure you know why—he's always winning. This spells trouble for us, because the odds of the matches that he's in look really bad, and there are never any surprises. Those who place bets don't win a lot of money and lose interest. That means our cut gets smaller in the long run.\r\n\r\nWe tried to bribe him into losing a match now and then, but he didn't know how to control his powers, and, well... I'll leave it at that.\r\n\r\nWe need to create some rules against him, like some sort of trap, and then we can ban him when he violates that rule. Then we create a shared black list and ban him from all of our matches forever. We need to make sure we're all on the same page, so that he doesn't think it's one of us picking on him.\r\n\r\nBut you can't get on his bad side. Refer him to some other jobs if you can. You want to keep your business running, right? Then be nice to him on the surface.\r\n\r\nThis concerns our collective interest, so let's put aside our differences for now.

He didn't know this was a dead-end when he borrowed the money, but once he did, he handled it in the only way he could—never returning any.\r\n\r\nSome say that when combined with interests, he owes the Chamber of Commerce an astronomical sum.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe debt collectors never managed to get any money from him, but they were beaten senseless every single time. They thought he had gang connections at first, but after further investigation, they had to admit that he had no such connections. The results were very vague: \"there is nothing on him, and this is all we have.\"\r\n\r\nHistory that cannot be fact-checked. Past that has been buried. A future without certainty.\r\n\r\nThe only thing they have is the present, but they don't even know how the name \"KING\" came about.\r\n\r\nMaybe people called him that because of how he forced his way to the top in the mines, or how he managed to stay at the top of the arena.

When Cocoritter mentioned that she wanted to go down to the surface and help the shelters, everyone opposed. Medical staff are not trained in combat, and Cocoritter certainly doesn't look like she can fight. Another staff member thought that Cocoritter should just give up without a fight if she encounters the Hyenas or another gang.\r\n\r\nTo everyone's surprise, Cocoritter showed off her fighting skills, which she learned from her sister. She couldn't take out enemies as fast as Executors could, but she was perfectly capable of defending herself. It also showed her determination to go down and help those at the shelter. To her, the decision means really applying what she has learned to help others, and not just going down to see what's out there.",

After Cocoritter descended, her parents hired an Executor to protect her during her journey. The replies from the Executor made them less worried as well: Cocoritter never put herself in danger, and warned other travelers about being deceived.\r\n\r\n The duality confused the Executor, who came to their conclusion after observing Cocoritter for a wihle: Cocoritter is still the same innocent girl that is willing to believe in others and thinks the world is full of kindness, but she is also always aware of the possible dangers. Maybe life in Hykros was so peaceful that Cocoritter naturally thought everyone could be trusted.\r\n\r\nThose at the lab still felt lost, though, because they hadn't seen Cocoritter's smile in a while, and they hadn't been able to hide her hat while she was distracted...",

Even the organizers didn't expect it, as the final amount far exceeded the predictions, and gave the shelters more resources than they planned.\r\n\r\n\"We only asked Cocoritter if there was anything she wanted to sell, and no one expected her to bring everything she made, including a scarf that she completed overnight.

Thanks to Cocoritter, the future began to regain meaning and hope, and more and more people started to look forward to it.\r\n\r\nAs for Cocoritter, what could the future have in store for her? Though she has inspired countless people, Cocoritter believes she still has much to experience. To her, the future is full of hope and expectation, not just for the people around her but for herself, as well.

Now they are confined somewhere by Hykros, and the family wealth is being slowly depleted to pay for their care.\r\n\r\nThat's why Pepper works in the medical department at Hykros. She chose to spend the rest of her life finding a way to cure the aberrants, and reverse their aberration...",

She has a condition that became resistant to just about every common drug they tried.\r\n\r\nTo cure her insomnia, they even tried going into her dreams to find the root of the problem so they could combat it.\r\n\r\nBut the results were not promising, and the doctor that came back from \"that place\" fell into silence and fear for a period of time. It took a lot of effort just to bring him back.\r\n\r\nWhen he finally spoke, he said that he couldn't describe exactly what happened in the dream and what he saw. After a while, all he could muster was that there was a thunderstorm that didn't stop. Then he put his head in his hands and sighed. Clearly, it was a suffocating nightmare.\r\n\r\nEventually, he concluded, \"Should we really cure her insomnia? I'm not trying to run away from my responsibility as a doctor, but I must say that if we have other means to somehow replenish the part of stamina that normally derives from sleep, maybe it's better for her if we leave her insomnia alone. After all, if I were having the same dreams every single day, I'd want to run away. If I could do that by staying awake, then I'd just not sleep and use my time to do something. At least when I'm awake, this world feels... safe. At least that's how I felt when I was 'there'.\"",

The older generation treats her like their daughter or granddaughter. In short, she is family.\r\n\r\nIf you come to Banges and she doesn't greet you, or if you don't see her mingling, worry not. She is only sleeping, and will join you in no time!",

She never hesitates when she buys, but she can also haggle like no other.\r\n\r\nMany years ago, Banges had a haggling contest to stimulate the economy, and it was something that no merchant wants to remember. Hilda came to see what was going on, and was somehow encouraged to join. At the age of 8, she became the unexpected winner of the contest. It was an important milestone for her, because she had never haggled before that. And because of her, it was the last time the contest was held.\r\n\r\nWhen Hilda goes to a store, the owner puts up their best defense to stop Hilda's onslaught, but it always ends with Hilda winning.\r\n\r\nThe merchants call her the \"Terminator,\" because their interactions always end on her terms. She quite likes the name, and even uses it on her precious weapon...",

With hair behind her ears and a pair of earphones, she's ready to go. Step on the gas, and let the wind take over. Just enjoy the speed. With a starting point and a goal, there is no getting lost. Everything is clear. Just ride!\r\n\r\nThe kids always ask for one more lap after they get off. Hilda pats their head, teaches them some safety rules, and tells them that they can only ride like her once they are fully prepared and have enough experience. They probably don't really understand too much, but since they adore her, at least they will listen to her...",

To her, Banges is the most important aspect of her life. It was where she grew up, and where she promised to protect. When those around her age all left Banges to look for something better, she stayed and did everything she could to help out this little port town.\r\n\r\nMaybe that's what's so special about her. She might be jealous of other people's interesting lives that are full of highs and lows, but she remains steadfast about staying here, and is taking the actions to fulfill her resolution.",

With a bite far worse than his bark, he exudes pure intimidation and aggression every minute of every day. Though his temper can be problematic, communicating with KING is far from difficult.\r\nConstantly seeking stimulation, KING prioritizes the satisfaction of material desires; to that end, he prizes concision and the clear monetary value of things, and hates liars and pretentious people.\r\nKING often resorts to violence in order to solve problems and obtain what he wants, and is not particularly fond of elaborate strategies (in combat, or otherwise).\r\nThose who spend a small amount of time with KING may realize that he is nothing more than a strong and simple man; they would do well to keep those thoughts to themselves, even if they mean no harm by saying so.",

He's been fighting since childhood and is a veteran brawler specializing in one-against-many. He would get lucrative pays for each job, only to supposedly blow it all immediately.",

In my journeys, I have saved countless people, slain countless bandits and murderers, and have always remained diligent in my responsibilities. Because of my faith and sense of duty, I was even able to bring Salome, the most wanted of the Heirs of Aida, to long-awaited justice.",
