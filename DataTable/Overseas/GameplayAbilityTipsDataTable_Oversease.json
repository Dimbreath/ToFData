Stack up to 3 times for 900% area damage.\r\n\r\nFrost: When paired with two frost weapons, the wind field is transformed into a wind field with frost. When enemies in the field receive 10 times of frost damage, they will enter the Frostbite state for 15 seconds. During this period, frost damage increased by 20%. The number of damage is not accumulated during the frostbite period.\r\n\r\nPhysical: When paired with two physical weapons, the wind field is converted into a physical wind field. For every 1% of the maximum HP lost by the target in the wind field, gain an HP shield within 3 seconds, which can be stacked.\r\n\r\nMix: When paired with any two different elemental weapons of flame, volt, frost, and physical, the wind field is not transformed, and the Wanderer's ATK is increased by 15% within the wind field.
